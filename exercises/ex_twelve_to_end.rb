# 14. In exercise 12, we manually set the contacts
#  hash values one by one. Now, programmatically 
#  loop or iterate over the contacts hash from exercise 12,
#   and populate the associated data from the 
#   contact_data array. Hint: you will probably need 
#   to iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), 
#   and some helpful methods might be the Array shift 
#   and first methods.

# Note that this exercise is only concerned with 
# dealing with 1 entry in the contacts hash, like this:

# contact_data = ["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"]
# contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}}
# As a bonus, see if you can figure out how
#  to make it work with multiple entries in the contacts hash.
